# Views

## Bootstrap 4 Views

The generated view files **use Bootstrap 4 by default** (for Laravel 5.6 and later).

## Bootstrap 3 Views

We can also generates views that use Bootstrap 3 with `--bs3` command option, eg for Laravel version 5.5.

## The Default Layout View

**You need** a `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` view file, simply create one with `php artisan make:auth` command. You can change this configuration via the `config/simple-crud.php` file.
